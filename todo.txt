current to-do list:
*********************
1. add '|| die' or '|| warn' functionality/error checking to SQL commands in php scripts
3. create cron daemon that cleans up studies > 6 months old (or how old? should users choose?) 
4. create page for found studies
5. Add functionality to check by accession if case is already tracked by this user, and just update it if it is
6. Add proper error logging/exception handling to case_checker.pl
7. Add code so that in case for some reason case_checker.pl gets run more than once per day, that it does an upsert, not just an insert into the database
11. Update the php scripts to all use mysqli or PDO rather than mysql_ (now deprecated).


completed to-do list:
***********************
2. create cron daemon that looks for daily new studies and adds entries to a new database table ('found_studies')
7. Update the user table in the DB with an email column. 
8. Make sure we're adding the user's email to the hash for the case in case_checker.pl
9. Update the email sending routine to undef the objects at the end
10. Consider adding a routine to just send one email tonight, not one email per study.
